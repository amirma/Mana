======= Mana Content-based Messaging System =======

Mana is a high throughput content-based, publish/subscribe messaging broker written in C++11.
At it's heart, Mana uses Siena Fast Forward (SFF) matching engine for matching messages
against subscriptions (see http://www.inf.usi.ch/carzaniga/cbn/forwarding/index.html).
